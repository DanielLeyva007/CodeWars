//Write a method that, given two arguments, width and height, returns a string representing a rectangle with those dimensions.

//The rectangle should be filled with spaces, and its borders should be composed of asterisks (*).

//For example, given width = 3 and height = 3:

//***
//* *
//***
//End each line of the string (including the last one) with a carriage return-line feed combination.

//Note: You may assume that width and height will always be greater than zero.
